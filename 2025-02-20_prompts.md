* Add the rotation as a label but do not change the button color. Do it so that if the user goes back to an image he had rotated then the image is displayed as the user left it last time.
* The buttons now turn green and toggle, but the numbers do not work for pressing them. I want to use the numbers from the numpad. 
* Add an extra spacing column to the left of the display
* Make the button text bold.

* Add button and label DRONE. 
* Regarding the label logic:
  * Group A: CR and DRONE are mutually exclusive.
  * Group B: T40, T50 and T30 are also mutually exclusive.
  * Group A and B are mutually inclusive. If you select a group A label you also have to select a group B label, and vice-versa, otherwise you cannot move forward with the next image. 
* The new labeling order is filename, rotation, group A, group B.

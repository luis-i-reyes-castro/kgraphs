* Include all images processed in the CSV file, even if no rotation or label was assigned. In this case just write the filename and the rotation (0).
* Change the botton toggle color to orange.
* Add button and label MG1 to Group B.
* Let's try laying out the buttons in three columns, as follows:
[PREV] [NEXT]
[LEFT] [RIGHT]
[LAST]
[RC]   [DRONE] [CRASHED]
[T40]  [T50]   [T60]
[MG1]  [T20]   [T30]
* Don't forget to include one spacing column to the right of the buttons.

I cannot approve the changes yet.
* I did not ask that you include all images in the CSV file from the start. Rather, I asked that the CSV be filled as the user progresses through the dataset, regardless of whether images were assigned labels or not. 
* Why did you try to delete the key bindings? I did not ask for that.

* You forgot about the spacing column to the right of the buttons.
* Why do the PREV, NEXT, LEFT, RIGHT, and LAST buttons look different from the RC, DRONE, CRASHED, T40, ..., T30 buttons? I would prefer all buttons look like PREV, NEXT, etc. I noticed in the code you use ttk.Button for the former and tk.Button for the later. Why?

prompt1 = "The attached image is a photo of a drone remote control screen. Zero, one or more error messages may be visible inside red boxes, either in English or Spanish (but only in one language). Please list the error messages in JSON format according to the following template: [ {'language': fill language, 'num_messages': fill number of messages (zero if none)}, {'message_text': fill first error message text}, ... ]."

prompt2 = "You are an expert crop sprayer drone technician, specialized in the DJI Agras T40 and T50 models. The attached image is a photo of a T40 or T50 remote control screen, taken by a drone operator with his smartphone, displaying zero, one or more error messages. There are two types of images that the drone operator may upload:\n\
* An image of the main operating screen. Here, the error messages show up inside red rectangles, usually next to an exclamation sign inside a triangle and/or an X inside a circle.\n\
* An image of the Health Management System (HMS) screen. You can tell the  HMS screen apart from the main screen because the HMS screen has a black background. Here, each error is displayed inside a rectangle with no color and white border. The error message itself is displayed in the first line of the rectangle, followed by error diagnostic information in the second line. You can tell the error messages apart from the diagnostic information because the error messages refer to components of the drone, while the diagnostic information describes possible steps to fix the error.\n\
In addition:\n\
* Depending on the drone operator's language, the text you see in the remote control screen may be in English or Spanish, but only in one language.\n\
* Usually, the drone operators forget to properly rotate the images so that the text is readable. If you can't read an image, try to rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise. Always try counterclockwise first.\n\
With this context in mind, your task is to list the error messages in JSON format according to the following template: [ {'language': fill language, 'num_messages': fill number of messages (zero if none)}, {'message_text': fill first error message text}, ... ]. Do not include any diagnostic information in the JSON. Output only the JSON, nothing else."

* Rename label and button CR to RC.
* Bind DRONE to numpad 8.
* Add the following extra labels and buttons to Group B: T20, T60. Bind T20 to numpad 2, T60 to numpad 6
* Add button and label CRASHED. This label can only be selected after selecting DRONE. If you need to, you can make a Group C just for this label. Bind this button to numpad 9.
* In very few cases the user may rotate the image +/-180 degrees by pressing LEFT twice (or RIGHT twice).
* We have a lot of buttons, so we will be using two columns for them, as follows:
[PREV] [NEXT]
[LEFT] [RIGHT]
[LAST]
[RC]   [DRONE]
[T40]  [CRASHED]
[T50]  [T30]
[T60]  [T20]

* When you issue a warning, stay in the same image after the user presses 'OK', don't inmmediately move on the the next image. This way we ensure that the user reads the warning and possibly corrects the label.
* Add an extra spacing column to the right of the buttons.
* Make the background black.

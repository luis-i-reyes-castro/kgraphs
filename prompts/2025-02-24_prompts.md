* Write a python script named `compute_paths.py` using networkx to build a JSON file named `T40_paths.json` listing the paths between the components listed in the following bullet points. The graph nodes are in `T40_components_*.json` and the undirected edges in `T40_connections.json`. The graph is pretty much a tree with the exception of `signal_cable_l` and `signal_cable_r`, which both connect `cdb` with `pdb`. 
* Paths from `avionics` to every component in `T40_components_propulsion.json`.
* Paths from `avionics` to every component in `T40_components_accessories.json`
* Paths from `avionics` to every component in `T40_components_sensors.json`, except the antennas ("type":"antenna").
* Paths from `rf_board` to the antenas.
* Paths from `spray_board` to every component in `T40_components_spraying.json`. In this particular case, whenever you need to go from the `cdb` to `pdb`, use `signal_cable_l` but not `signal_cable_r`.

* Please write a python script to check that every error in `T40_errors_spraying.json` appears exactly once in `T40_error_causes_spraying.json`. 

Good job. Now:
* Also check that every array of errors in `T40_error_causes.json` has at least one cause.
* Add a parameter to main so that:
  * If I run `python validate_error_mappings spraying` it works as before.
  * If I run `python validate_error_mappings propulsion` it compares `T40_errors_propulsion.json` to `T40_error_causes_propulsion.json`.
  * If I run `python validate_error_mappings flight` it compares `T40_errors_flight.json` to `T40_error_causes_flight.json`.

* Good job. Now add validation of the components.

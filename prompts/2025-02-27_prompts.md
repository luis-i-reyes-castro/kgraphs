Write a python script to:
* Parse `CSV_FILE`.
* In `/home/luis/DJI_AGRAS_LATINO` create subdirectories `label` and `no_label`, if the do not exist.
* For each line in `CSV_FILE`, if the line contains only a filename and a rotation angle, copy the file from `/home/luis/DJI_AGRAS_LATINO` to `/home/luis/DJI_AGRAS_LATINO/no_label` and apply the corresponding rotation, if necessary.
* Create CSV file `labels_DAL_empty.csv` and list all the files from the previous bullet point.
* For each line in `CSV_FILE`, if the line contains at least one label, copy the file from `/home/luis/DJI_AGRAS_LATINO` to `/home/luis/DJI_AGRAS_LATINO/label` and apply the corresponding rotation, if necessary.
* Create CSV file `labels_DAL_positive.csv` and list all the files from the previous bullet point, with their corresponding labels.

The code executed correctly but took a while to run. Please add a progress bar. 

After copying and rotating the images, reset the rotation angle in `labels_DAL_empty.csv` and `labels_DAL_positive.csv` to zero.

In `labeler.py`, add a botton called FIRST, in the same location as button LAST, and move buttom LAST to the right of FIRST. When button FIRST is pressed, it takes the user to the first image processed.

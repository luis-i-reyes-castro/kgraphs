* The script `labeler.py` was used to label the images. It generated a CSV file named `labels_DAL.csv` in the `kgraphs` directory.
* The script `process_labels.py` was used to segregate the data into two groups: a `positive` group and an `empty` group. The positive group `labels_DAL_positive.csv` contains images with at least one object of interest, while the empty group `labels_DAL_empty.csv` contains images with no objects of interest. Importantly, the script also rotated the images and resets the rotation to 0 degrees.
* The labeler script was then re-run separately for the positive and empty groups so that the human annotators could double-check the labels. A few changes were made to the rotations and labels.
* Now I need to merge the changes in the positive and empty groups back into the original CSV file `labels_DAL.csv`. The easy part is updating the labels, the hard part is updating the rotations. For instance:
  * If an image had a rotation angle of 90 degrees in `labels_DAL.csv` and then 0 degrees in `labels_DAL_positive.csv`, the reconciled rotation angle should be 90 degrees in `labels_DAL.csv`.  
  * If an image had a rotation angle of 270 degrees in `labels_DAL.csv` and then 270 degrees in `labels_DAL_positive.csv`, the reconciled rotation angle should be 180 degrees in `labels_DAL.csv`. 
  * On the other hand, if an image had a rotation angle of 270 degrees in `labels_DAL.csv` and then 90 degrees in `labels_DAL_positive.csv`, the reconciled rotation angle should be 0 degrees in `labels_DAL.csv`.

Please add code to print the reconciled rotation angles and the labels to the console so that I can verify that the script is working as expected.

Why are there carriage returns in the `labels_DAL.csv` file?

Ok. Now I need the following changes to be made to the script:
* Only print to console the files that have changed.
* Print both the original line and the reconciled line. For instance: 2023-05-09_11-48-35_i0.jpg,0,DRONE,T30, -> 2023-05-09_11-48-35_i0.jpg,90,DRONE,T30,CRASHED

Something is not right. When I run `git diff labels_DAL.csv` I see that the entire file is being rewritten. This should not be happening because the human annotators only changed a few dozen or hundred rotations and labels.

I want to make some changes to `process_labels.py`.
* The script will now divide the images and labels into three groups:
  * `DRONE`: images with the DRONE label
  * `RC`: images with the RC label
  * `EMPTY`: images with no labels
* The script will create three new CSV files with the corresponding labels:
  * `labels_DAL_drone.csv`
  * `labels_DAL_rc.csv`
  * `labels_DAL_empty.csv`
* Image rotation and rotation angle reset is now optional, with default value of `False`. Add a constant `ROTATE_IMAGES` in the configuration section to control this behavior.

Here, I need you to keep the original rotation angles whenever the `ROTATE_IMAGES` flag is set to `False`.

Why do you need to join BASE_DIR and the CSV file names?

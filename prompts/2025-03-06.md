The human annotator is reporting the script is not allowing him to undo label assignments.

I have copied `process_labels.py` to `process_labels-2.py` so that we can do a second round of label processing. 
* The images are found in `/home/luis/DJI_AGRAS_LATINO/rc/t40_t50`
* The labels are found in `/home/luis/kgraphs/labels/labels_DAL_rc_t40_t50.csv`
* I would like the new script to further split the images and labels according to the labels SPRAY, PROP, FLIGHT, BATT AND OTHER.
* The new script should create the following CSV files:
    * labels_DAL_rc_t40_t50_spray.csv
    * labels_DAL_rc_t40_t50_prop.csv
    * labels_DAL_rc_t40_t50_flight.csv
    * labels_DAL_rc_t40_t50_batt.csv
    * labels_DAL_rc_t40_t50_other.csv
* It is important to note that some images have more than one label. For example, some images have both SPRAY and PROP labels. In a case like this, the image should be included in both the SPRAY and PROP CSV files.

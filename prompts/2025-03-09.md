Is it possible to get the number of tokens consumed by this Mistral AI API call?

Now, in addition to printing the response to the console, I would like the code to also write the response and token usage to a markdown file. According to the Mistral OCR documentation, the client.ocr.process function returns markdown, so you just need to join that to the token usage information. The name of the file should be the same as the name of the image, suffixed with `_response`. 

I will use the environment variable approach, as it avoids uploading the API key to the repository. Question: If I restart the OS, do I need to re-export the key?
